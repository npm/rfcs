# Run `prepare` Scripts for Linked Bundled Dependencies

## Summary

Following discussion on [#477](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/477) and previously on [#463](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/463), workspaces that depend on sibling workspaces via the `file:` protocol (a.k.a. linked or symlinked dependencies) should run the sibling workspaces' `prepare` scripts as part of the depend-_ing_ workspace's `pack` operation when those sibling dependencies are also specified as bundle/d dependencies (e.g. their "built" output should make it into the packed workspace's tarball).

## Motivation

It's common for workspaces in a monorepo to depend on one another. Calling `npm pack` on a workspace should automatically run the `prepare` script of any linked and bundled dependencies so that the produced tarball will have consistent and correct contents without a bunch of extra wiring.

## Detailed Explanation

`app-a` and `pkg-b` are workspaces in a monorepo. `app-a` depends on `pkg-b` and lists it as a `bundledDependency` because `app-a` is expected to be distributed as a Node app somewhere (AWS Lambda, Docker, etc.) where it should be deployed along with its production dependencies. `pkg-b` is not published to a registry for reasons, and is written in a language or standard that must be compiled or transpiled to be runnable in Node (TypeScript, ES2049, etc.).

Assuming `app-a`s package.json contains this:

```json
{
  "name": "app-a",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "pkg-b": "file:../pkg-b"
  },
  "bundleDependencies": ["pkg-b"]
}
```

… and `pkg-b`'s package.json contains this:

```json
{
  "name": "pkg-b",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "tsc"
  }
}
```

… with the appropriate tsconfig.json, .npmignore, and index.ts in `pkg-b`, running `cd app-a ; npm i --package-lock=false ; npm pack` should produce a tarball with contents like:

```sh
app-a
├── node_modules
│   └── pkg-b
│        ├── index.js
│        └── package.json
└── package.json
```

## Rationale and Alternatives

This functionality is possible today, but requires the package being packed to explicitly call the `prepare` scripts of each of its linked and bundled dependencies.

It's also possible to achieve the same end result by publishing the bundled dependencies to a registry, but for a package that's expected to have utility only within the context of other workspaces in a monorepo this adds a bunch of bureacracy for not much benefit.

## Implementation

Need help with this part.

I don't think there's anything here, but leaving it for now in case I've missed/forgotten something.
